The Acqu Ecosystem
==================

This repository shall be the common code basis of acqu users within
the A2 collaboration. It will (at least) cover the calibration and a
simple physics analysis.

However, this master branch is still under heavy development and many
changes could break your workflow or personal code. But this will
improve!

So be warned, but don't hesitate to fork this repo here and contribute
your personal changes if there useful by providing pull requests.
